The favicon.ico file is a binary file that typically contains an image. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image and save it as `favicon.ico` in the specified directory. 

You can use an online favicon generator to create a favicon from an image or design one using graphic design software. Once you have the image, save it in the `/personal-bio-website/personal-bio-website/public/` directory as `favicon.ico`.
